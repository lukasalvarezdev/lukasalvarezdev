I build apps with React, TypeScript, Remix, NextJS, Prisma, and Node, always aiming for clean code and great UX. Iâ€™m focused on creating simple, accessible solutions to real problems.

I like working on tough projects with teams that care about impact, where I can mentor, push for better code, and make a difference. Honesty, directness, and being involved in the business side are important to me.
